STASFTP

STASFTP is built upon python ftplib and syncs local files/directies with remote
directories on an FTP (via FTPS), additionally it encrypts/decrypts these files
on-the-fly (prior to upload/after download) without using addtl. diskspace usually.
In case files cannot be encrypted due to lack of memory (pycrypto needs lots
of RAM), these files are uploaded unencrypted!!

Usage:
------
    stasftp --local /path/to/sourcedir --remote /path/on/ftp --mode backup/restore
            --log logfile_in_~/.stasftp/log --exclude excludefile_in_~/.stasftp/exclude
    stasftp -l /path/to/sourcedir -r /path/on/ftp --m backup/restore                         
            -o logfile_in_~/.stasftp/log -e excludefile_in_~/.stasftp/exclude

    stasftp default dir: ~/.stasftp -> will be created on first run

    excludefile contains a list of all directory that should not be synced
    
    if mode == backup:
            backups --local to --remote doing in-memory on-the-fly encryption
    if mode == restore:
            restore --remote to --local doing in-memory on-the-fly encryptio

Keys / Ciphers:
---------------
    For filenames Vignere-encryption is used, for files AES.
    Keys are either autogenerated and saved in ~/.stasftp/keys/AES_key and ~/.stasftz/keys/VIGNERE_key
    (if not yet existant) or loaded from this file.

    !!! ONCE THIS FILES ARE GENERATED STORE THEM ON A SAFE PLACE AS WITHOUT THEM ENCRYPTED FILES
    !!! CANNOT BE DECRYPTED ANYMORE!!!

Directory/file structure:
--------------------
    ~/.stasftp/config/stasftp.cfg	config file	
    ~/.stasftp/exclude/			exclude file location	
    ~/.stasftp/keys/			keys are stored here (AES & VIGENERE)
    ~/.stasftp/log			directory for log files
    ~/.stasftp/tmp			dir for temp. files, do not touch/change
